# Use the `input()` function to prompt a user to enter something.
# input() always returns a string value. If you ever want someone
# to enter a number you have to use the `int()` function to convert
# what they typed in to a string.

#Create a simple calculator that first asks the user what method they would like to use (addition, subtraction, 
#multiplication, division) and then asks the user for two numbers, 
#returning the result of the method with the two numbers. Here is a sample prompt:

#What calculation would you like to do? (add, sub, mult, div)
#add
#What is number 1?
#3
#What is number 2?
#6
#Your result is 9
operation = input('''
Please type in the math operation you would like to complete:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
''') #''' three single-quotes allow you to make a string on multiple lines

number_1 = int(input('Enter your first number: '))
number_2 = int(input('Enter your second number: '))

if operation == '+':
    print('{} + {} = '.format(number_1, number_2))
    print(number_1 + number_2)

elif operation == '-':
    print('{} - {} = '.format(number_1, number_2))
    print(number_1 - number_2)

elif operation == '*':
    print('{} * {} = '.format(number_1, number_2))
    print(number_1 * number_2)

elif operation == '/':
    print('{} / {} = '.format(number_1, number_2))
    print(number_1 / number_2)

else:
    print('AHHHHHHGGGG THATS NOT MATH')
