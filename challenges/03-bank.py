#Create a prompt that asks the user if they would like to display their balance, 
#withdraw or deposit. Write three methods to perform these calculations and output the result to the user.

#Gather user input using the input function. Note that input always returns user input 
#as a string. You have to manually convert it to an int or a float to make it behave like number. Also, end 
#the input prompt with a \n newline character if you want the user to type in on the next line.

#age = input("How old are you?\n")
#age = int(age)
